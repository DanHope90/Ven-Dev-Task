## Introduction ##

This is a technical for Venn Digital where I had to replicate a website design along with adding a slider and hover states. 

The language and framework/library I chose to do this project in was React.js

## Instillation ##

Install dependencies run npm i inside my-app folder
To run the application in your browser run npm start in your terminal 

## Dependencies ##

react": 18.2.0
react-dom:  18.2.0,
react-icons": 4.6.0
react-scripts: 5.0.1
web-vitals":  2.1.4

## What would I have done differently if I had more time? ##

- Create a slider would navigate down the webpage from Home > Footer (or use React Switches)
- I would add a return to a home button within the footer 
- I would have made the home icons interactive
- Style my slider properly and be able to highlight each cards border
- Made it responsive for other devices. e.g. Mobile and tablets
